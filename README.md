This repository contains the custom-made scripts used for data analysis in Ochirova et al, "HP1β and densely packed chromatin form separate microdomains in mouse ES cells, which are reconfigured upon exit from naïve pluripotency", BioRxiv 2025.

The scripts are organised into folders based on the figure from the publication they are linked to. Please refer to the publication for additional details.
